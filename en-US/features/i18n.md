```

LANGS = en-US,zh-CN,zh-HK,de-DE,fr-CA,nl-NL

```

## Contribute Translation

Sign up account on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs) and fill untranslate strings.

Sometimes, you will find it's quite hard to translate a sentence from English to your language, do not panic! Just present the idea and don't have to match the exact words in English version.

Finally, make a Pull Request to Gogs project. Awesome!

## Custom Locale Files

If you're not satisfied with official locale translation, you can modify those fields with another file in `custom/conf/locale/locale_<lang>.ini`, and then restart Gogs.
