# Localize Gogs

Gogs starts support multiple languages feature since release `v0.5.0`, and it's just about a single click to change interface language instantly.

To enable them in the `custom/conf/app/ini`:

```
[i18n]
LANGS = en-US,zh-CN,zh-HK,de-DE,fr-CA,nl-NL
NAMES = English,简体中文,繁體中文,Deutsch,Français,Nederlands
```

## Contribute Translation

All locale files are stored in directory `conf/locale`, there are all built-in, you don't need to rebuild Gogs or anything to change the interface language. 

Obviously, we need your help for making more translations of languages you're good at. To do that, just fork the [Gogs](https://github.com/gogits/gogs) project, and make changes under `conf/locale` folder. Keep in mind that you should use the naming convention of locale file `locale_xx-XX.ini`, and use English version(`locale_en-US.ini`) as base file.

Sometimes, you will find it's quite hard to translate a sentence from English to your language, do not panic! Just present the idea and don't have to match the exact words in English version.

Finally, make a Pull Request to Gogs project. Awesome!

## Custom Locale Files

If you're not satisfied with official locale translation, you can modify those fields with another file in `custom/conf/locale/locale_<lang>.ini`, and then restart Gogs.
