```

## Contribute Translation

Sign up account on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs) and fill untranslated strings.

Sometimes, you will find it's quite hard to translate a sentence from English to your language, do not panic! Just present the idea and don't have to match the exact words in English version.

In case you want to test your translation, and avoid make changes in Git history, you can put your locale file into `custom/conf/locale/<file>` and restart Gogs.

### Make Corrections

If you found wrong translation strings, to quick search on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs), you need to type key name in the search box.

For example, suppose you think `Home` is a wrong translation, do not search `Home`, instead, search its key name `home`. Similarly, search something like `home:uname_holder` for keys under section.

## Custom Locale Files

If you're not satisfied with official locale translation, you can modify those fields with another file in `custom/conf/locale/locale_<lang>.ini`, and then restart Gogs.
